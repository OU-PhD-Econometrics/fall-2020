# Optimal stopping

- Today we'll get back to the dynamic models we discussed a few weeks ago

- To start with, let's discuss the theory of .hi[optimal stopping]

- Gives mathematical context for maximizing rewards or minimizing costs

- Optimal stopping problems are by definition dynamic



---
# Examples of optimal stopping problems

- Many economic problems involve some sort of optimal stopping:

    - The Secretary Problem (when to hire from a sequence of job candidates)
    
    - Seach theory more generally (job search, spousal search, house search, ...)
    
    - "Buy/sell/hold" problems (e.g. stock/options trading)

    - Replacement problems (e.g. infrastructure)

- Optimal stopping problems inherently have a tension between costs and benefits:

    - It is costly to interview job candidates
    
    - But it is also costly to miss out on the best candidate


---
# Mathematics of optimal stopping

- In a discrete choice setting, .hi[dynamic programming] is the best solution method

- Within a discrete choice setting, time can be either continuous or discrete

    - If continuous time, use Hamiltonians and Differential Equations
    
    - If discrete time, use recursive methods
    
- Solution method also depends on the time horizon

    - If the time horizon is finite, then we can use dynamic programming
    
    - If the time horizon is infinite, then need to (also) solve for a fixed point
    
- We will discuss these details today

---
# Finite horizon problems

- Individual $i$'s .hi[flow utility] for option $j$ at time $t$ is:
\begin{align*}
U_{ijt}&=u_{ijt}+\epsilon_{ijt}\\
&=X_{it}\alpha_j+\epsilon_{ijt}
\end{align*}
- $i$ chooses $d_{it}$ to maximize her .hi[expected lifetime utility]
\begin{align*}
\max \mathbb{E}\sum_{\tau=t}^T\sum_{j}\beta^{\tau-t}1\left[d_{it}=j\right]U_{ijt}\left(X_{it},\epsilon_{ijt}\right)
\end{align*}

---
# Expectations and assumptions

- $i$ takes expectations over $X$'s (future states) and $\epsilon$'s (future errors)

- $\epsilon$'s are assumed to be iid over time

- Future states are not affected by $\epsilon$'s except through choices:
 
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}(X_{t+1}|d_t,...,d_1,\epsilon_t,...,\epsilon_{1})&=\mathbb{E}(X_{t+1}|d_t,...,d_1)
\end{align*}


---
# Two-period example

- Consider the utility of choice $j$ in the last period:
\begin{align*}
U_{ijT}&=u_{ijT}+\epsilon_{ijT}\\
&=X_{iT}\alpha_j+\epsilon_{ijT}
\end{align*}

- Define the .hi[conditional valuation function] for choice $j$ as the flow utility of $j$ minus the associated $\epsilon$ plus the expected value of future utility conditional on $j$:
\begin{align*}
v_{ijT-1}&=u_{ijT-1}+\beta \mathbb{E}\max_{k\in J}\left\{u_{ikT}+\epsilon_{ikT}|d_{iT-1}=j\right\}
\end{align*}
where $\beta$ is the discount factor
- Suppose $X_{iT}$ was deterministic given $X_{iT-1}$ and $d_{iT-1}$ and the $\epsilon$'s are T1EV
- What would the $\mathbb{E}\max$ expression be?


---
# When Dynamics Don't Matter
- As in static models, we need to normalize with respect to some alternative

- Suppose we normalize with respect to $j'$:
\begin{align*}
v_{ijT-1}-v_{ij'T-1}&=u_{ijT-1}+\beta \mathbb{E}\max_{k\in J}\left\{u_{ikT}+\epsilon_{ikT}|d_{iT-1}=j\right\}-\\
&\phantom{\text{-}-}u_{ij'T-1}-\beta \mathbb{E}\max_{k\in J}\left\{u_{ikT}+\epsilon_{ikT}|d_{iT-1}=j'\right\}
\end{align*}

- If the two expected future value terms are equal, we get a cancellation

$\implies$ choices have to (at least probabilistically) affect the future states

- The simplest way to satisfy this condition is to have switching costs in the model

- Intuition: switching costs make one think carefully about changing course

---

# Finite Horizon Dynamics
In period $T-1$ we have:
\begin{align*}
v_{ijT-1}=u_{ijT-1}+\beta \mathbb{E}\max_{k\in J}\left\{u_{ikT}+\epsilon_{ikT}|d_{iT-1}=j\right\}
\end{align*}
Rolling back one more period,
\begin{align*}
v_{ijT-2}=u_{ijT-2}+\beta \mathbb{E}\max_{k\in J}\left\{v_{ikT-1}+\epsilon_{ikT-1}|d_{iT-2}=j\right\}
\end{align*}
Keep going back and the $\mathbb{E}\max$ operator can always be expressed as functions of the next period conditional value functions:
\begin{align*}
v_{ijt}=u_{ijt}+\beta \mathbb{E}\max_{k\in J}\left\{v_{ikt+1}+\epsilon_{ikt+1}|d_{it}=j\right\}
\end{align*}

Another name for $\mathbb{E}\max_{k\in J}\left\{v_{ikt+1}+\epsilon_{ikt+1}\right\}$ is....

# Stochastic $X$'s
- Let $f_{jt}(X_{it+1}|X_{it})$ be the pdf associated with moving from $X_{it}$ to $X_{it+1}$ given choice $j$ at time $t$ 

.hi[Example:] suppose we were interested in Covid on OU's campus. The choice set is {close campus, open campus but online classes, in-person classes}. The transitions on the $X$'s would be the Covid case (or fatality) counts associated with each of the choices. 

Since these Covid case probabilities do not depend on the $\epsilon$'s, it is convenient to integrate them out of the future utility term

The conditional value function is then:
\begin{align*}
v_{jt}(X_{it})&=u_{jt}(X_{it})+\beta \int_{X_{it+1}}\mathbb{E}_{\epsilon}\left\{\max_{k\in J} v_{kt+1}(X_{it+1})+\epsilon_{ikt+1}\right\}dF_{jt}(X_{it+1}|X_{it})
\end{align*}


---

# Stochastic $X$'s 2
If the $\epsilon$'s are distributed Type 1 extreme value, what is the expression for the conditional value function?


What about the general GEV case?


We can then start at the last period and work our way backwards to obtain all of the relevant conditional value functions

---

# Choice Probabilities

- The choice probabilities are then calculated in the same way as in the static case

- The only difference is now we use $v$'s instead of $u$'s

- In the multinomial logit case we have:

\begin{align*}
p_{jt}(X_{it})&=\frac{\exp(v_{jt}(X_{it}))}{\sum_{k\in J}\exp(v_{kt}(X_{it}))}
\end{align*}

---


# Estimation

- The likelihood of the data is:

\begin{align*}
\mathcal{L}(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)&=\prod_i\prod_t\prod_j\left[p_{jt}(X_{it},\alpha,\beta,\gamma)f_{jt}(X_{it+1}|X_{it},\gamma)\right]^{d_{it}=j}
\end{align*}
where $\gamma$ governs the transitions of the $X$'s

- The log likelihood is then given by:
\begin{align*}
\ell(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)&=\sum_i\sum_t\sum_j (d_{it}=j)\left\{\ln[p_{jt}(X_{it},\alpha,\beta,\gamma)]+\ln[f_{jt}(X_{it+1}|X_{it},\gamma)]\right\}
\end{align*}

Since the log likelihood function is additively separable, we can estimate $\gamma$ in a first stage


---

# Infinite Horizon
\begin{align*}
v_{j}(X_{i})&=u_{j}(X_{i})+\beta \int_{X'}V(X')dF_{j}(X'|X_{i})\\
&=u_{j}(X_{i})+\beta \int_{X'}E_{\epsilon'}\left(\max_{k\in J} v_{k}(X')+\epsilon'_{ik}\right)dF_{j}(X'|X_{i})\\
\end{align*}
which in the Type 1 extreme value case for the $\epsilon$'s yields:

\begin{align*}
v_j(X_i)=u_j(X_i)+\beta\int_{X'}\ln\left(\sum_{k\in J}\exp[v_{k}(X')]\right)dF_j(X'|X_i)+\beta c
\end{align*}

Now, stack the conditional value functions for each possible state and choice. Because the $v$'s are on both sides of the stacked equations, we need to solve for a fixed point

(This works because it is a contraction mapping)

---

# Infinite Horizon 2
Let $\mathcal{X}$ denote the number of states $X$ can take on

The stacked equations are then:
.smallest[
\begin{align*}
\left[\begin{array}{c}v_1(X_1)\\
v_1(X_2)\\
\vdots \\ 
v_1(X_{\mathcal{X}})\\
\vdots\\
 v_{J}(X_{\mathcal{X}})\end{array}\right]=
\left[\begin{array}{c}u_1(X_1)+\beta\int_{X'}\ln\left(\sum_{k\in J}\exp[v_{k}(X')]\right)dF_1(X'|X_1)+\beta c\\
u_1(X_2)+\beta\int_{X'}\ln\left(\sum_{k\in J}\exp[v_{k}(X')]\right)dF_1(X'|X_2)+\beta c\\
\vdots\\
u_1(X_{\mathcal{X}})+\beta\int_{X'}\ln\left(\sum_{k\in J}\exp[v_{k}(X')]\right)dF_1(X'|X_{\mathcal{X}})+\beta c\\
\vdots\\
u_J(X_{\mathcal{X}})+\beta\int_{X'}\ln\left(\sum_{k\in J}\exp[v_{k}(X')]\right)dF_J(X'|X_{\mathcal{X}})+\beta c\\
\end{array}\right]
\end{align*}
]

- Plug in values for the parameters and take a guess at the $v$'s
- Substitute in for the $v$'s on the right hand side which gives us a new set of $v$'s
- Repeat until convergence

# Optimal stopping in `r Citet(biblio,"rust1987")`

- Rust analyzes the decision to replace a bus engine $(d=1)$ or not $(d=0)$

- How is this an optimal stopping problem?

    - The maintenance superintendent ([Harold Zurcher](https://twitter.com/haroldzurcher87)) wants to minimize costs

    - But he also doesn't want buses to break down while in service

    - Premature replacement can be very costly, but so is in-service breakdown

    - The goal is then to figure out when to optimally replace engines

    - Especially when some buses might happen to get driven more than others

---

# `r Citet(biblio,"rust1987")`

- Replacement decision depends upon the mileage on the engine, $x$, the cost of replacing the engine $\overline{P}$ and the scrap value of the current engine $\underline{P}$ 

- The payoffs net of the error term are given by:
\begin{align*}
u_0(x_i,\theta)&=-c(x_i,\theta)\\
u_1(x_i,\theta)&=-[\overline{P}-\underline{P}+c(0,\theta)]
\end{align*}

- Mileage is discrete and transitions according to some process $f(x_{t+1}|x_t)$

- Example: some probability of staying at the current mileage, some probability of moving up one mileage state and some probability of moving up two mileage states

---

# Estimation

1.  Calculate the mileage transitions, i.e. get  $f(x_{t+1}|x_t)$

2.  Maximize the log likelihood of the choices:
\begin{align*}
\ell(\theta)=\sum_i\sum_t \sum_j (d_{it}=j)\ln(p_{jt}(x_{it},\theta))
\end{align*}

3.  Within the maximization routine, solve a fixed point problem in the $v$'s each time the log likelihood function is evaluated

- For your problem set, I'll walk you through how to estimate a model similar to Rust's
